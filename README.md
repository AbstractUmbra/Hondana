# mangadex.py

A lightweight and asynchronous wrapper around the [Mangadex v5 API](https://api.mangadex.org/docs.html).

### Features

| Ratelimits?      | [ ]          | Not part of the API spec but might be handy.       |

### API caveats to note

There are no API endpoints for Artist. Currently if you query a manga without the `"artist"` query includes then you will not recieve artist data.
