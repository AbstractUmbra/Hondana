<br>

A lightweight and asynchronous wrapper around the [MangaDex v5 API](https://api.mangadex.org/docs.html).
You can see our stable docs [here](https://hondana.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)!

## Features
We are currently at 100% feature compliance with the API.

## Notes
### Authenticated endpoints
Sadly (thankfully?) I am not an author on MangaDex, meaning I cannot test the creation endpoints for things like scanlators, artists, authors, manga or chapters.
I have followed the API guidelines to the letter for these, but they may not work.

Any help in testing them is greatly appreciated.

### Upload & Creation
Following the above, this means I also cannot test manga creation or chapter creation/upload.
These are currently implemented but untested.

## Examples
Please take a look at the [examples](./examples/) directory for working examples.

**NOTE**: More examples will follow as the library is developed.

### API caveats to note
- There are no API endpoints for Artist. It seems they are not differentiated from Author types except in name only.
  - I have separated them logically, but under the hood all Artists are Authors and their `__eq__` reports as such.
- The tags are locally cached since you **must** pass UUIDs to the api (and I do not think you're going to memorize those), there's a convenience method for updating the local cache as `Client.update_tags`
  - I have added [an example](./examples/updating_local_tags.py) on how to do the above.
  - To use these tags, you can see an example [here](./examples/search_manga.py#L17-L22).
