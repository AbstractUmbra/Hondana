# Hondana Changelog
Fix release and new features.

## Added
Added a new user friendly way to submit reports to MangaDex. (9885597e6c8ac63e860c80ec2091109c82ff78e8 and 4ba859911a2137ccfe52dbe676493a9bb772e780)
- Included a new [local cache](./hondana/extras/report_reasons.json) of the report reasons which are loaded as an enum.
- Included a new [example](./examples/submitting_a_report.py) for using the report method.
Removed `Client.get_report_reason_list()` public method as this was not user friendly or utilised. (820a8d65fe16b7bf61803014e1f7655efe0eac89)

## Changes
Removed preflight items from within the exposed source code to a private part of local CI. (80f2229d3901a285b00f1e0d9a12a8baeccb8dd3)
New batch of test payloads as the previous iterations had broken data with no resolution in sight. (1e732e3ba17345bb2adbe8a1211004253e3bd31b)


## Fixes
Fixed `Artist` and `Author`'s `.biography` property from being incorrectly accessed if the `"en"` key did not exist and relevant tests for such. (1e732e3ba17345bb2adbe8a1211004253e3bd31b)
Fix the internal HTTPClient type being accessed at runtime unnecessarily. (3e62a2964a208549c7b4cd4c9458ffcca7079c3f)

### Notes
Deprecation of `Client.mark_chapter_as_read()` and `Client.mark_chapter_as_unread()` in favour of `Client.batch_update_manga_read_markers()`. (5b6070b55c51aae4cbe70dfe501f1ff1ab7fd06e)
