## Added

## Changes

## Fixes
- Some bad documentation parameters. (5744f24a16575fe93b54129d8b651cc807df0fbc)

### Notes
- Chapter reporting is now opt-in due to developer statements that it is unmaintained and causing infrequent/sporadic erroring with CloudFlare.
  - The reporting code still works, but it is opt-in now, if you choose to opt-in, then it will attempt to report and log any failures and continue.

- The Terms of Service you are requested to accept for chapter uploading can be found [here](https://mangadex.org/compliance).
